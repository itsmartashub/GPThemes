## Permissions

-   **Storage**: GPThemes requests permission to access browser storage to save your chosen theme name, custom accent color, custom font properties and custom chat/prompt width. This ensures a consistent and personalized experience across ChatGPT website.
-   **ChatGPT Website Access**: GPThemes requires access to specific URLs to modify the visual appearance of the ChatGPT website. This includes `https://chat.openai.com/` and `https://chatgpt.com/` (new domain). This access is necessary for the extension to function properly and provide a customized interface.

## Supported Versions

> [!WARNING]
> Please be aware that GPThemes is currently tailored to enhance the experience for `GPT-4o`, `GPT-4o mini`, `GPTs Store`, `DALLE` and `Browsing and Data Analysis`.
> The `o1-preview`, `o1-mini` models are not fully supported yet! Probably the style is not as intended for certain elements! </br>
> Exploring and editing all elements of those may be considered in future updates.

## Disclaimer

-   I'd like to remind you that **ChatGPT frequently updates its website**, and even minor changes can sometimes cause unexpected issues with the extension's functionality and appearance.
-   Your patience are greatly appreciated. If you notice any obvious issues with the appearance or functionality of the extension, I'm likely already working on it or it has already been fixed, but the new release is not pushed yet or the Chrome Store hasn't yet reflected the changes live. You can track the status on GitHub to stay informed.
-   Please note that this is a hobby project and it all depends on my available free time, so it might take a little while to get everything up and running. </br>

**Thank you for your understanding.**
