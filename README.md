## Permissions

-   **Storage**: GPThemes requests permission to access browser storage to save your chosen theme name, custom accent color, custom font properties and custom chat/prompt width. This ensures a consistent and personalized experience across ChatGPT website.
-   **ChatGPT Website Access**: GPThemes requires access to specific URLs to modify the visual appearance of the ChatGPT website. This includes `https://chat.openai.com/` and `https://chatgpt.com/` (new domain). This access is necessary for the extension to function properly and provide a customized interface.

## Compatibility

> [!WARNING]
>
> -   GPThemes is designed to provide customization experience for the core ChatGPT interface. It is optimized to work with free accounts and key features.
> -   While the extension will likely function with a `Plus` subscription and `Pro` models, some of its styling may not be fully optimized for the advanced UI elements or features unique to that version. Exploring and editing all elements of those may be considered in future updates.
> -   The extension is built to work with all languages, but its visual appearance is currently fine-tuned for English. I'm actively removing English-specific selectors in favor of more multilingual methods with almost every update.

## Disclaimer

-   I'd like to remind you that **ChatGPT frequently updates its website**, and even minor changes can sometimes cause unexpected issues with the extension's functionality and appearance.
-   Your patience are greatly appreciated. If you notice any obvious issues with the appearance or functionality of the extension, I'm likely already working on it or it has already been fixed, but the new release is not pushed yet or the Chrome Store hasn't yet reflected the changes live. You can track the status on GitHub to stay informed.
-   Please note that this is a hobby project and it all depends on my available free time and motivation, so it might take a little while to get everything up and running. </br>

**Thank you for your understanding.**
